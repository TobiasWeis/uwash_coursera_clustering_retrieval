# University of Washington - Machine Learning - Clustering & Retrieval
Here is my code for the coursera-course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval/home). 

Needed packages: SFrame (representation similar to pandas dataframe, but originated from graphlab and has some addition features)

Make sure to download the data before using the scripts (get_data.sh)
